  // The result is highly nondeterministic. Here are a few ways it can play out:
  //
  // - s1 may complete before the error in s2 is encountered, in which case nothing will be printed and no error will occur.
  // - s2 may encounter the error before any of s1 is emitted. When the error is reraised by s2,
  //   that will terminate the merge and asynchronously interrupt s1, and the take terminates with that same error.
  // - s2 may encounter the error before any of s1 is emitted, but during the period where the value is caught by handleErrorWith,
  //   s1 may emit a value and the take(1) may terminate, triggering interruption of both s1 and s2,
  //   before the error is reraised but after the exception is printed! In this case, the stream will still terminate without error.
  //
  // The correctness of your program should not depend on how different streams interleave, and once again,
  // you should not use handleErrorWith or other interruptible functions for resource cleanup. Use bracket or onFinalize for this purpose.
